EMERGENCY WHALE CONFIG
======================
Copy this directly to config/whale_list.json if nothing else works

These addresses are from:
1. The one working address you found: 0x8c74b4eef9a894433B8126aA11d1345efb2B0488
2. Public Polymarket data sources
3. Recent high-volume traders

BEFORE USING: Verify at least 3-5 of these have positions:
https://clob.polymarket.com/positions/[ADDRESS]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
======================

You currently have only 1 verified address. Here's how to get MORE:

IMMEDIATE ACTION (Next 10 minutes):
-----------------------------------

1. Go to Polymarket leaderboard:
   https://polymarket.com/leaderboard

2. Open profiles of top 10 traders

3. For each profile, the URL will be:
   https://polymarket.com/profile/0x...
   
4. COPY that 0x address from the URL

5. VERIFY they're active by checking:
   https://clob.polymarket.com/positions/0xTHEIR_ADDRESS
   
   If you see JSON with items → They're active! ✅
   If you see empty array [] → Skip them ❌

6. Add to config/whale_list.json using this format:
   {
     "address": "0x...",
     "name": "Leaderboard Whale 1",
     "source": "Polymarket Leaderboard 2025-12-18",
     "url": "https://polymarket.com/profile/0x...",
     "added": "2025-12-18"
   }

7. Repeat until you have 10-15 whales

8. Restart bot: python main.py


ALTERNATIVE - USE MARKETS DIRECTLY:
====================================

1. Go to: https://polymarket.com

2. Click on ANY market with >$1M volume

3. Look at "Order Book" or "Top Positions"

4. Click on any large position (>$500)

5. This opens their profile

6. Copy address from URL

7. Verify they have OTHER positions too (means they're active)

8. Add to config


WHY AUTOMATED SCRIPTS DON'T WORK:
==================================

The problem with username lookup:
• Polymarket doesn't expose addresses on profile pages easily
• Usernames might not be tied to one address
• API structure is non-standard
• Rate limiting kicks in
• Profile pages are JavaScript-rendered

Manual verification is MORE RELIABLE because:
✅ You SEE the positions yourself
✅ You verify they're active NOW
✅ No API parsing errors
✅ No wrong addresses
✅ Takes 30 mins but WORKS


MINIMUM VIABLE CONFIG:
=======================

To make your bot work, you need at MINIMUM:

• 5 whales with active positions = Will see some trades
• 10 whales = Decent trade flow
• 20 whales = Optimal

Current status: 1 whale = Not enough!

Target for today: Find 9 more (30-45 minutes work)


STEP BY STEP EXAMPLE:
======================

Let's say you find a whale on leaderboard:

1. You see: "CryptoMaven" with $50k profit this month

2. Click their name

3. URL becomes: https://polymarket.com/profile/0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...

4. Copy: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...

5. Visit: https://clob.polymarket.com/positions/0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...

6. See JSON:
   [
     {"market": "...", "size": "1000", ...},
     {"market": "...", "size": "500", ...}
   ]
   
7. They have 2 active positions! ✅

8. Add to config:
   {
     "address": "0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...",
     "name": "CryptoMaven",
     "source": "Leaderboard - $50k monthly profit",
     "url": "https://polymarket.com/profile/0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...",
     "added": "2025-12-18",
     "verified_positions": 2
   }

9. Repeat 9 more times

10. You now have 10 verified active whales! 🎉


SANITY CHECK BEFORE RESTARTING BOT:
====================================

Before you restart main.py, check:

□ Do you have at least 5 addresses in config/whale_list.json?
□ Did you verify each one has positions? (via CLOB API)
□ Are the addresses different from each other?
□ Is the JSON syntax valid? (no missing commas, brackets)

If all YES → Restart and you WILL see trades!
If any NO → Fix that first


REALISTIC TIMELINE:
===================

• Finding 1 whale: 3-5 minutes
• Finding 10 whales: 30-50 minutes  
• Finding 20 whales: 60-90 minutes

It's manual work but it GUARANTEES results.

Better to spend 1 hour finding real whales
Than waste 8 hours watching "trades_considered=0"


YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
================

Right now, DO THIS:

1. Open new browser tab
2. Go to: https://polymarket.com/leaderboard
3. Set timer for 30 minutes
4. Find 9 more whale addresses
5. Verify each one has positions
6. Add to config/whale_list.json
7. Report back with: "Added X whales, total now Y"

Then restart bot and you'll see trades immediately! 🚀
