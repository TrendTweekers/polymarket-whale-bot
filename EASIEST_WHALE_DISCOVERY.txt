"""
EASIEST AUTOMATED WHALE DISCOVERY
==================================
Use existing whale tracking services instead of building from scratch!

I found 4 services that already track whales for you:
"""

# METHOD 1: PolyWhaleFeed.com (BEST FOR ADDRESSES)
"""
What: Real-time feed of ALL $10k+ trades on Polymarket
Cost: FREE
Data: Shows wallet address, market, amount, timestamp

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to: https://polywhalefeed.com/
2. Watch the feed for 30 minutes
3. Copy 10-15 addresses that appear multiple times
4. Add to your config/whale_list.json
5. Restart bot

Why it works:
✅ Addresses are already doing $10k+ trades = proven whales
✅ Real-time, so you get currently ACTIVE whales
✅ Free, public data
✅ No scraping needed
"""

# METHOD 2: PolyWatch Telegram Bot (BEST FOR ALERTS)
"""
What: Free Telegram bot that broadcasts whale trades
Cost: FREE
Data: Instant notifications when whales trade

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to: https://www.polywatch.tech/
2. Start the Telegram bot
3. Use /watch command with whale addresses
4. Get instant DM when they trade
5. Bot tells you their address automatically

Commands:
/watch 0xADDRESS - Track a whale
/unwatch 0xADDRESS - Stop tracking
/list - See your tracked whales

Why it works:
✅ Built by ForgeLabs, trusted
✅ 100% free forever
✅ Can copy addresses from alerts
✅ Shows $1k+ and $25k+ trades separately
"""

# METHOD 3: PolyTrack "Dev Picks" (BEST FOR QUALITY)
"""
What: Pre-vetted whales with verified performance
Cost: FREE for 3 whales, $19/mo for unlimited
Data: Win rate, P&L, full history

Criteria:
• 60%+ win rate
• $100k+ volume
• 50+ positions
• Consistent monthly profits

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to: https://www.polytrackhq.app/
2. Browse "Dev Picks" section
3. Click on whale profiles
4. Copy their wallet addresses from URL
5. Add to config/whale_list.json

Why it works:
✅ Already filtered for 60%+ win rate
✅ Pre-verified profitability
✅ Cluster detection (finds related wallets)
✅ Free tier gives you 3 whales
"""

# METHOD 4: Polymarket Analytics (BEST FOR VARIETY)
"""
What: Trader leaderboards with full analytics
Cost: FREE
Data: Every trader, sortable by category

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to: https://polymarketanalytics.com/
2. Click "Traders" or "Leaderboards"
3. Sort by P&L or volume
4. Filter by category (Politics, Crypto, Sports)
5. Click traders, copy addresses

Why it works:
✅ Comprehensive database
✅ Can filter by specialization
✅ See trading patterns
✅ Free access
"""


# AUTOMATED SCRIPT USING THESE SERVICES
"""
Instead of scraping Polymarket directly, we:
1. Monitor PolyWhaleFeed for addresses
2. Verify those addresses have positions
3. Add to config automatically

This is what automated_whale_finder.py does.
"""


# RECOMMENDATION: HYBRID APPROACH
"""
STEP 1 (10 minutes):
1. Visit PolyWhaleFeed.com
2. Watch feed, write down 10 addresses you see multiple times
3. Add all 10 to config/whale_list.json

STEP 2 (5 minutes):
1. Run automated_whale_finder.py
2. It scans orderbooks, finds 5-10 more
3. Auto-adds to config

RESULT:
• 15-20 verified active whales
• Mix of manual (guaranteed) + automated (bonus)
• Takes 15 minutes total
• Bot starts getting trades immediately

This is the BEST method:
✅ Fast (15 min)
✅ Reliable (verified addresses)
✅ Automated (script does heavy lifting)
✅ Quality (all currently active)
"""


# QUICK START COMMANDS
"""
# 1. Start bot with current whales
python main.py

# 2. While bot runs, open browser:
https://polywhalefeed.com/

# 3. In another terminal, run whale finder:
python scripts/automated_whale_finder.py

# 4. Check how many whales you have now:
# Look in config/whale_list.json

# 5. If still <10 whales:
# Manually add 5 from PolyWhaleFeed.com

# 6. Restart bot:
# Ctrl+C, then python main.py
"""

Time 0:01 - Open PolyWhaleFeed.com in browser
Time 0:05 - Run automated_whale_finder.py
Time 0:08 - Script finishes, finds 5-10 whales
Time 0:10 - Manually add 5 from PolyWhaleFeed
